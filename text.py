                            DAN-SUDOKU USER MANUAL

Dan-Sudoku is a puzzle game based on a 9 by 9 array of numbers. Positions on the puzzle are referred to by their row and column number. For instance, the topmost left corner on the puzzle is row 1, column 1(r1c1), and the bottom right corner on the puzzle is row 9, column 9 (r9c9).

The row numbers and column numbers are shown, around the puzzle, to assist the player in identifying the different positions on the puzzle. The puzzle is subdivided into 9 sections made up of 3 by 3 arrays. For instance, section 1 is made up of r1c1,r1c2,r1c3,r2c1,r2c2,r2c3,r3c1,r3c2,r3c3.

The main rule governing solving Dan-Sudoku puzzles is that each row, column, and section must have only one occurence of the digits 1 through 9. In addition, a digit may not be ommitted; hence, the player is expected to fill all empty positions(denoted by asterisks) with a digit between 1 to 9 (inclusive) while ensuring that no digit appears more than once in any row, column, or section.

The puzzle gives the user prompts he/she needs to answer in order to complete the puzzle. Thus, the player needs to type the difficulty level of his/her choice(easy, medium, hard, or expert), the row and column number of the position he/she intends to fill, and , then, the digit he intends to fill into the empty spaces(represented by asterisks) on the puzzle. Note that the player needs to press the "enter" key on the keyboard after supplying the answer to whatever question the game prompts. 

A Dan-Sudoku puzzle has between 20 to 50 of it's position filled depending on the difficulty level selected by the player,i.e. the more the difficulty level selected the more the number of positions on the puzzle that the player is expected to fill.

HINT: There is one and only one solution to the Dan-Sudoku puzzle. It may be solved through logic and deduction, and no guessing is required. Although guessing might provide the right answers, players are discouraged from guessing to enable them test their brain and expose their cognitive abilities.

Again, to complete Dan-Sudoku puzzle, you need to deduce the placement of the digits (0-9) while ensuring that the main rule of the game is adhered to.
